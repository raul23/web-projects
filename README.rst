  - `./projects/timer (github) <./projects/timer>`_
  - `codepen.io <https://codepen.io/raul23/pen/rNZMyzZ>`_
- **Languages:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Description:** You can set the timer (its minutes and seconds), start it and stop it.

  - Minutes must be at least 0
  - Seconds must be between 0 and 59 (inclusive)
  - The minutes and seconds can be incremented/decremented with arrows (up/down) or entered directly into the input field
  - If minutes or seconds are negative (when entered directly into the input field), they will be rejected and the previous 
    valid ones will be used to continue the count of the timer
